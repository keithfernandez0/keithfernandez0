# Welcome to my profile.
- Currently interested in botany and mycology.
- Enrolled at Kean University, for a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Cybersecurity.
- I’m currently learning statistics and psychology in highschool.
- I aspire to be in the cybersecurity industry as a pentester, ethical hacker or SysAdmin.
- The culture of hacking is extremely fascinating to me, and I love more than anything to engage with it and support it.
- I’m looking to collaborate on small-scale projects and builds, and in the future I wish to be involved in kernel development and building tools for redteam/blueteam operations.
- Reach me on my [Twitter page](https://twitter.com/keithfernandez0), where I post (mostly retweet) stuff about CTFs, Linux, malware and hacker stuff.

### Current projects:
- Building an Obsidian Vault for all of my ethical hacking and coding projects.
- Learning C.
