# Welcome to my profile.
- My name is Keith! :D
- Currently interested in plants and mycology, PC building, and making aesthetics for my desktop environments.
- I’m currently learning statistics and psychology, 
- I’m looking to collaborate on small-scale projects and builds, and in the future I wish to be involved in kernel development and building tools.
- Reach me on my [Twitter page](https://twitter.com/keithfernandez0), where I post stuff about CTFs, Linux, malware and hacker stuff.

## Current projects:
- Building an Obsidian Vault for all of the ethical hacking and coding projects.
